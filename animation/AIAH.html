            <h2>About AIAH</h2>
            <p> Her favourite colour is black.
                Aiahs hobbies include swimming and drawing.
                 Her special talent is modelling.
                 She auditioned for PBB but wasnt successful, so instead, her former casting manager suggested for her to audition for Darna’s role to gain exposure from Starhunt’s managers. Luckily Starhunt looked through her auditions again and brought her in the training program of Starhunt Academy.
                 Aiahs favourite SHA subject is dancing.
                Life Motto: ”Keep your eyes on the stars and your feet on the ground.”

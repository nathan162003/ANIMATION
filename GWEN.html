                 She does not like peanuts.
                 Gwen’s hobbies include collecting heels and doing makeup. She can do different makeup styles even Instagram filters but at the moment she is practising aesthetic make-up.

                 Her special talent is modelling.
                 Gwen loves old songs and probably can ace the songs of Karen Carpenter of the Carpenters.
                 She joined a lot of school activities, such as parades and street dancing competitions.
                 Gwen was a part of a talent show in Albay to further enhance her skills in singing and modelling. She was invited to big mall events as a singer-model or a guest singer which is where she earned some money to help her family.
                 She was once a majorette.
                 Before entering the Star Hunt Academy, she was a former PBB (Pinoy Big Brother) housemate during PBB Otso Batch 3. Unfortunately, she was evicted on the 36th day of the show.
                 After the PBB show, she was recruited as a trainee because of her amazing talent in singing.
                 Gwens favourite SHA subject is singing.
                Life Motto: ”Life is not about waiting the storm to pass, but learning to dance in the rain.”
